# SelectionofShoppingStore

This project demonstrates problem solving and analytical skills. Tim and Susan were faced with the challenge									
of selecting the store from which they needed to purchase their school supplies.									
									
There are three stores from which they have options to make their purchases and they include: Walt-Mart, 									
Dollar Trap and Office Repo. The Store prices for each school supply varies and therefore, the total price would be 									
different. 									
									
The total cost for the shopping list for Tim and Susan were calculated by multiplying the quantity of items by 									
the unit cost of each stores. 									
									
A bar chart was used to visualized the total cost of the company's price for both Tim and Susan as shown   									
 in the viz sheet. From the two charts, the Walt-Mart, Dollar Trap and Office Repo Total Price are $121.35,									
$124.85 and $156.55 for Tim and $82.79, $87.54 and $103.29 respectively. It was noted that Walt-Mart Store									
 has the least total price for both Tim and Susan.									
									
Therefore, I would recommend that Tim and Susan purchase their school supplies at Walt-Mart Store.
